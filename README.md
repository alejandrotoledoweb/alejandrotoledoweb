In my previous jobs, I developed the skill to reach high standards while delivering projects, I always keep and love learning new things and face new challenges to prove myself and to learn from them.

If you ask me what would make me happy?
I can tell you that building and maintaining projects by coding would be a lot of enjoyment for me. The tech industry is growing up so fast and is something that really catches my attention and I want to be part of that evolving process while I continue learning more and put that knowledge into practice.
